# Computer_Vision_and_Path_Planning_Project
I have implemented three projects related to computer vision and path planning.

Part 1: A real-time Maze solver using Dijkstra's and A* Algorithms implemented on Python and OpenCV

Part 2: a Kalman Filter implemented in Python to accurately estimate the motion parameters of a robot 
        using the robot's motion data obtained from the robot's sensors
        
Part 3: Pose Estimation using Aruco Tag => A Python code to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a laptop's webcam using a set of checker-board images
for real-time Aruco tag detection from the webcam video stream, estimating its pitch, roll, yaw and distance relative to the webcam
